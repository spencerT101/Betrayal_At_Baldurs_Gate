# MVP

The project is to design a web app game version of the board game, Betrayal at Baldurâ€™s Gate. Given the restricted timelines for the sprint the project must:

- Have board of Building Tiles.
- Player can move across the board.
- The front end displays information on the user position on the board in text.
- User can navigate turns using directional buttons.
- Players should not be able to move off the board.
- When a player moves an event card, omen card or monster is randomly selected and displayed as text.
